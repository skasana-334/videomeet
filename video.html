/ What is the use of useParams in React?
The useParams() hook is a React Router hook that allows you to access the parameters of the current URL. This can be useful if you want to dynamically render content based on the URL parameters. For example, if you have a blog application, you may want to render different articles based on the article ID in the URL.

//What does it mean for a function to be async?
Async functions- a promise-based library that offers a declarative API to make API calls,it allow the calling program to perform other operations while method is being called

The word “async” before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise. Other values are wrapped in a resolved promise automatically. For instance, this function returns a resolved promise with the result of 1 ; let's test it: async function f() { return 1; } f()
